ROBOT REPAIR

Main Menu -> just options, quit, play, high scores (networked?)
Start game
* have option to skip tutorial
* tutorial teaches basics
-> get given a robot
-> robot says its problem
-> can use manual for reference
-> solve the problem by using the appropriate tool on the appropriate body part
-> when you think the problem is fixed, hit DONE!!

How does it work?
* oil can be used to fix parts that are stuck
* rags can be used to fix parts that are dirty
* wrench can be used to fix parts that are leaky
* welder can be used to fix parts that are damaged
* power cable can be used to fix parts that are low on battery
* ammo box can be used to fix parts that are.... low on ammo

okay never mind all of that instead:
* oil pours up to a certain line
* there are buttons you play simon with
* there is a battery that moves up and down and you hit stop when it's at the right level
* there is wavelength, and you turn two knobs to align it

Under the hood, each robot has 5 body parts: head, torso, l/r arm, l/r leg.
Parts that move (legs, arms, head) have Oil values. keep them high or they get STUCK.
All parts have CLEAN values. keep them high or they get GRIMY.
All parts have INTEGRITY values. keep them high or they get DAMAGED.
All parts have ENERGY values. Keep them high or they get DRAINED.

Weapons have AMMO values. Keep them high or they get SPENT.
Robots with jetpacks have FUEL values. Keep them high or they get SPENT.

* each round will introduce a new mechanic. at first it's just the welder, then the oil, then the rags, etc
* at the end of the round, all the robots you repaired go out to fight.
* each robot goes out - if it was repaired properly, it fights. otherwise, it breaks down.
* a number of enemies approach and fight your robots. any that make it through deal damage.
* the game ends if your base ever runs out of health.
